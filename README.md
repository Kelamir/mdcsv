# mdcsv

Convert markdown to CSV, for creating Anki flashcards from markdown header ### as the question and following paragraphs, until the next header, as the answer.

## Usage

Ensure that your desired markdown file is named `input.csv` and is located in the same folder as the `mdcsv` tool.

Execute the command `$ go run .`

You will obtain the `output.csv` file once it's finished.

Import the generated output.csv file into Anki, and behold! Your flashcards are ready for use.
